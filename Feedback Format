- Lack of preparation was visible in the inability to answer questions .
-The Candidate struggled with clarity and precision in his technical explanations, often resorting to general terms and lacking depth in his responses.
- He showed a lack of confidence and hesitation in answering questions about view encapsulation, pure and impure pipes, and interceptors in Angular.
- The Candidate had limited knowledge of Node.js's module system and was unable to differentiate between CommonJS and ES modules.
- There was a misunderstanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript and the use of async-await or Promises.
- He displayed a fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between the browser and Node.js environments.
- His answer to writing a MongoDB query to find employees with today's date of birth showed a gap in database query skills. 
- Failed to provide an efficient algorithm for finding the top 10% largest numbers in a dataset.
 - Inadequate explanation of creating a RESTful API with complex search queries, filtering, sorting, and pagination.
 - Lack of familiarity with writing a custom promise library in JavaScript.
 - Incorrect or incomplete answers regarding the use of pr children in React.
 - Limited understanding of GraphQL and its application in front-end development.

 Conclusion: 
-There was some confusion during the interview when The Candidate was not sure about certain concepts, such as the interceptor,viewEncapsulations, etc in Angular.
-lacked depth and were limited to theoretical knowledge rather than practical application.
-The candidate could not even solve a simple problem to sort employees' arrays in JavaScript.
-Overall the performance is poor.

Areas of Improvement: 
 - Improve knowledge of efficient algorithms for large datasets, focusing on time and space complexity.
 - Gain a better understanding of creating RESTful APIs with complex search queries, filtering, sorting, and pagination.
 - Familiarize with writing custom promise libraries and understanding promise chaining and error handling.
 - Enhance understanding of props.  Children in React and its practical applications.
 - Learn about GraphQL and its integration with front-end frameworks like React. 

 Conclusion: 
The candidate demonstrated technical skills in React and Django, with a grasp of optimization techniques and state management. 
However, there are significant gaps in their understanding of algorithms, RESTful API design, and advanced JavaScript concepts.  
Given the strengths and weaknesses, the candidate's performance can be classified as below average.  

JavaScript: Below Average

communication
"The candidate explained their thought process clearly while solving the algorithmic question, which made it easy to follow their approach. They asked clarifying questions and communicated uncertainties well."

Collaboration Attitude
"They were open to hints and engaged collaboratively when suggestions were offered. This indicates strong potential for working well in a team environment."

Problem-Solving Mindset
"Demonstrated a structured approach to solving problems. Even when they got stuck, they stayed calm and tried multiple strategies instead of giving up."

🔧 Constructive Feedback Examples
Communication
"The candidate’s explanation of their approach was minimal, making it hard to assess their reasoning. Encouraging them to verbalize thoughts more would help in collaborative settings."

Coachability
"The candidate was somewhat resistant to feedback during the session and seemed to dismiss alternative approaches without consideration. This could affect collaboration with team members."

Time Management
"Spent a bit too much time optimizing early on before having a working solution. Would benefit from balancing correctness and optimization more effectively."

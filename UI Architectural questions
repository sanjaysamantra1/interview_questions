Q1. How would you ensure that websites are accessible to all groups including users with disabilities.
     - Autofocus
     -Add alt text to images
     -Use headings properly
     -Use ARIA landmarks (Accessible Rich Internet Applications )
     -Add labels to form fields
     -color contrast

Q2. Describe the process for creating a responsive design that works across multiple devices
     -using semantic HTML tags
     -use ARIA attributes
     -alternative text for images
     -test code with various browsers and devices
     -Breakpoints. Each web page should have a minimum of three breakpoints (mobile, tablet, and desktop)

Q3. Describe the life cycle of any task in front end development
Ans: Requirement gathering - understanding the features and functionalities
     Sketch the layout
     Design the visual elements : design the visual elements of the UI, such as colors, typography, and icons
     Develop the UI
     Test the UI
     Iterate and improve
     Launch the UI

Q4. Why several .env files?
Ans: By using multiple .env files, developers can define environment-specific variables, making it easier and more practical 
   to manage and maintain the application across different environments. 
   For example, a development environment might use a different database or API key than the production environment.
   a. development b. testing 3. production

Q5. Do we have to use SCSS/SASS for every project?
Ans: No, you do not have to use SCSS/SASS for every project, and regular CSS is often enough.
    SCSS/SASS is a preprocessor for CSS that allows you to write CSS with variables, nested selectors, functions, and more. 
    It can help you write more organized and maintainable CSS, but it is optional for some projects.

Q6. Debugging tools and techniques for front end development?
Ans: Browser developer tools
     Console logging
     Code Breakpoints
     Testing - Unit Testing, Integration testing, E2E
     Code reviews

Q7. How do you ensure cross-browser compatibility for your front end applications?
Ans: -Use a CSS reset or normalize stylesheet to ensure consistent default styling across different browsers.
     -Use modern web development practices such as responsive design, CSS flexbox, and grid layout, which work well across different browsers.
     -Test your application on different browsers and platforms using tools such as BrowserStack or Sauce Labs.
     -Use feature detection instead of browser detection to determine which features are available on a particular browser, and provide fallbacks for unsupported features.
     -Use polyfills or shims to provide support for missing features or APIs on older browsers.
     -Minimize the use of browser-specific features and APIs, and use standardized APIs whenever possible.
     -Regularly update and maintain your application to ensure compatibility with the latest browser versions.
     -Use cross-browser compatibility libraries, such as Modernizr,

Q8. Mention ways to decrease page load time?
     -Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML
     -Image optimization
     -Browser cache
     -Compress and optimize content  (Gzip)
     -Remove render-blocking JavaScript (async,defer)
     -use CDN
     -Lazy Loading

Q9. Describe your approach to writing clean, maintainable code.
     -readability , maintainability , Security
     -organize code into logical chunks(Write Modular and Reusable Code)
     -DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle and Avoid Duplicating Code or Logic.
     -Keep Functions and Classes Small and Focused
     -comment on each section
     -consistent naming conventions
     -formatting guidelines 

Q10. What strategies do you use to debug and troubleshoot errors in your code?
     -Isolate the issue by examining the source of the error and determining what caused it
     -use logging or other tools to capture detailed information about the state of the application
     -code analysis tools

Q11. What to look for in a code review?
     -Verify feature requirements
     -Assess readability
     -Test maintainability
     -Check for security vulnerabilities
     -Comment
     -naming conventions
     -Documentation
     -Code Duplication?
     -Possible Performance Improvements
     -Unit Tests?

Q12. Popular Types of Security Attacks
     -Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks: XSS attacks occur when malicious code is injected into a web application and executed within a user’s browser. This can lead to the theft of sensitive data and other malicious activities.
     -Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks: CSRF attacks involve tricking users into performing actions they didn’t intend to take. Attackers exploit the trust that a website has in a user’s browser to execute unauthorized actions.
     -Injection attacks: Injection attacks, such as SQL injection, involve inserting malicious code into input fields, which can then be executed on the server side, potentially compromising sensitive information.
     -Security risks in external scripts: Third-party libraries and external resources in your web application can introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly vetted.
     -Broken access control: Broken access control occurs when users can access unauthorized areas or perform actions they shouldn’t. It’s a critical security flaw that threatens data confidentiality and application integrity.

Q13. Front-end security best practices
     -Input validation and sanitization
     -Avoid inline scripts
     -Static Code Analysis Tools - ESLint
     -Audit your NPM Packages (npm audit)
     -Bundle and Minify Code
     -Secure Communication (HTTPS) - encrypt data transmitted between the client and server
     -Enable CORS
     -Authentication and Authorization - JWT
     -Token Expiration and Refresh
     -User Activity Monitoring (logging)
     -Regular Security Audits

Q14. How do you handle state management in large applications?
     -Local State
     -Lifting State Up
     -Context API
     -State Management Libraries
     -hooks
     -GraphQL

Q15. Authentication & Authorization
     Authentication :  is the process of verifying the identity of a user
     -User Registration and Login
     -Password Management : Use strong hashing algorithms , Implement password policies , password recovery and multi-factor authentication
     -Sessions and Tokens : Tokens can be stored in local storage 
     -Secure Transmission : Use HTTPS
     
     Authorization : determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do
     -Role-Based Access Control : Assign roles (admin, user, guest) to users and define permissions based on these role
     -Attribute-Based Access Control : Grant access based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions.
     -Access Control Lists : Maintain lists specifying which users or roles have access to specific resources.
     -Middleware for Authorization : Implement middleware in your application to check user permissions before granting access to specific routes or resources.

Q16. Things to consider while developing a multilingual website
     -Language Selector
     -Use of the <html lang=""> Attribute
     -Localization (i18n)
     -Localization Tools & Libraries (React intl , i18n)

Q17. Performance Optimization tips
     -Reduce HTTP Requests
     -Use HTTP-2

     -reduce the complexity of css selectors
     -use flexbox
